reorganize your graph into a directed graph,
  with two directed edges (u->v, v->u) for each original edge (u-v)

while there is a path P from A to H:
  (hint: use breadth first search to find paths - long story here)
  //augment the path P:
  for each edge (u->v) in P:
    remove (u->v) from the graph and add (v->u) to it
    (if v->u isn't there already)

Label all vertices as reacheable or not reacheable from A.

The bottleneck edges is the set of edges
  that connect a reacheable and a unreacheable vertex
